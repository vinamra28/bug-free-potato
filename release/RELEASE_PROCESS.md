## Release Process

This document mainly focuses on the release process which we can try to adopt.

## Current Scenario

- Our team current cuts the release from github UI for instant process
- No proper versioning is followed
- No major release has been cut as of now for any of the applications
  - If we cut the release as well then no such differentiation
- Banks have different requirements for the same application
